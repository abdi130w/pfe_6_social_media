# مقدمة
نظرا للوضع الحالي الذي تشهده منصات التعليم الرقمي و التبادل المعرفي من تقسيمات فالمجتمعات الرقمية ووجود اختلاف في نوع الخدمات المقدمة : مشاركة الملفات التعليمية ، منصات تبادل المعارف ... و نظرا لكون كامل هذه الخدمات تستخدم بصفة موحدة من طرف طلبة العلم فإن هذا الفصل في الخدمات يشكل عائق كبير أمام تجربة التعلم الرقمي و ذلك لعدة عوامل :

+ تعدد المنصات مايجعله من الصعب على المتعلم أي يتابع كل منصة على حدة و هو ما يفسد تجربة التعلم
+ منصات التبادل المعرفي لا تتواجد بصفة مستقلة بل تتواجد كجزء من مجتمعات رقمية أخرى غير معنية بالتعليم اطلاقا مثل Facebook أو Telegram وهو مايمثل أكبر عائق للمتعلم بحيث أن تنوع المحتوى على هذه المنصات يشكل تشتيتا لذهن المتعلم و الأهم أنه يفتح الباب لانخراط أفراد ذو أهداف غير تعليمية داخل هذه المجموعات و افساد تجربة التعليم لهم (تجربة متكررة)
+  ظهور منصات بيع الدورات على أنها منصات تعليمية لكن في غالب الأمر تكون هذه المنصات ذو أهداف تجارية فقط دون مراعات لجودة المحتوى التعليمي و غياب الاهتمام الكامل ببناء مجتمع رقمي

وعليه فإنه بناءا على هذه التحديات التي تواجه المتعلم و لملئ الفراغ الموجود في سوق التعليم و المتمثل ف غياب منصة موحدة تجمع خدمات التعليم الرقمي بهدف بناءا مجتمع تعليمي رقمي تم تصميم منصة "تعلمي" لتلبية هذه الاحتياجات
# Abstract

The Current State of online education and Learning collaboration has always been segmented across multiple platforms from knowledge gathering, document resourcing and peer networking which made it hard to find one place that satisfies all the learners needs and that is distraction free

In Algeria the eLerning state is no different but face more problems :

+ students starting from Secondary/High school to University rely on Facebook groups and Telegram Channels to source their learning material and find study buddies even then some of the specializations including ENS (Ecoles Nationales Supperieur), the current tools are unreliable and chaotic and not learning friendly at all
+ Private school each launching their own 'Courses Platform' has became an economical movement that is only for profit and drops the value from the beginning, since most of these are separate instances of WordPress shops that only focuses on selling courses, one of which had even gone so far to sell Ai transcript audio

This Gape in the market and none centralized services represents an opportunity to satisfy real need and learn from previous mistakes by : Creating a multi services platform that is composed of : Forum Style Community-based Reddit-like communication platform where students exchange knowledge and a private schools courses listings that links students to real tutors to address quality learning

# 1 - Introduction

The main goal of the platform is to provide a scalable ecosystem, The platform is mainly a web application that has two services :

**Forum Service**

+ Students create accounts, browse and search every posted thread

+ Students has the ability to post threads or request new communities

+ Up/Down vote evaluation systems, which enables users to judge the content and filter out the none-related / low quality postings

+ Each users has a ranking system that is auto evaluated based on contributions and recognized efforts by peers (if his content is upvoted or downvoted)

+ Students can report inappropriate content which get reviewed by admins

+ The platform auto-ban inappropriate and rule violating content based on keywords

**Course Listing Service**

+ Users can use the service to view **REAL** listings of **In-Person** courses offered by **Qualified** teachers

+ Acts as a **Catalogue** that links students and Teachers

+ The service main revenue comes from private schools who pays to get their offers listed

In brief that two services provides a centralized platform for students to find learning resources easily and without the distraction of classical social media services

# 1.1 - Origins of the idea

+ Absence of real learning focused networking solutions

+ Absence of real document sharing solution : websites such as dzexams and ency-education are unreliable since they host their files on free hosting external services such google drive that expires after few days alongside being very limited since they don't offer the opportunity to share documents

+ Outdated Old fashioned forums such as : djelfa forums that are not practical and not user friendly (outdated UI and bad UX)

+ Absence of lasting universal educational platform that isn't dependent on specific private school

+ Absence of user adaptability toward modern solutions such as : Reddit or Discord

Due to these faced problems we identified a need for a centralized ecosystem rather than specific service which suggested the idea of **Taloomi** a platform that is distraction free by design and offers balanced access to resources

# 1.2 - Market study

The choice of Forum-style platform is rooted in the need for knowledge focus rather than content consumption and based on history of attempted social media platforms they all shared the same characteristic of : Attempting to target broad audience and create local alternatives of big social media platforms such Facebook which all end up falling for not providing any added value, the most recent adopted solution is : iTop [1] which aims to be free-speech arabs social media platform which got its popularity due to the political state of Gaza

So, we realized the need for providing learning friendly experience, Alongside that there do exist communities such as on Discord but what makes it less of a competitor is : Absence of pre-established community, since Most of discord servers represent communities that are established else were and based on small experiment we made by creating educational servers we noticed the following limitations :

+ Absence of adoption of such solution due to users simply being unused to it (tested with Computer-Science students)
+ Adoption of alternatives such as Telegram that is mostly used for resource sharing rather than networking and communication

So, we concluded that the market offers a real opportunity for such targeted use case

The Second choice of public course listings rather than courses marketplace such as udemy, is due few reasons :

+ Low quality content that accompanies marketplaces (anyone can publish a course)
+ The need for a centralized listing that enables learners to find local schools

And so far there is no such service that provides such link between schools and potential customers

**In Brief** : the current market lacks such niche solution that provides the ecosystem as a whole

# 1.3 - Upgrade factor

In terms of digital services it is usually an automation of service but in this case and in terms of operating the services the real upgrade is under few functional important points :

+ Centralization : one place that is resourceful and universal

+ Reputation : each community on the forum builds a reputation which makes it hard for scammers perform short-term scams such as selling low quality courses and disappearing which is what happens with most 'educational platforms'

+ Networking: by organizing communities based on interest, each student find the best place that suits him and makes it easier to join efforts with people who shares same interests

# Conclusion

The app main goal is to address the need for a unified learning platform by providing user-friendly services and it avoids fall outs by addressing a niche community of learners and providing their needs and building a system that relies on trust
