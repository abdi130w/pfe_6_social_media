# 5.1 - Conclusion

The full process from identifying the problem, studying the market to understand the real needs then designing the ecosystem and implementing the prototype, is the first step towards addressing the state of online education in Algeria and providing All-In-One solution that scales based on needs and adoption by the targeted customers

This process allowed us to :
+ Think in Design-First approach by identifying problems and following a multi-services architecture to study, design and integrate each service to satisfy best the requirements
+ Study different approaches when it comes to picking the right software, mainly on the community service to find that Community-style forums satisfies best our needs
+ Choose best collaborative methods as developers and best methods by using containers that allows us to handle any breakage on the software with more structured and approachable way
+ Keeps the room open for satisfying other requirements that aren't identified yet by following multi-platform design

So in conclusion designing and implementing this solution is the first into addressing a real problem on the real world

# 5.2 - Perspective
