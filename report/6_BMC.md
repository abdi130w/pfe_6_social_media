# Advantages

+ Forum-Style: distraction free by design, focuses on the knowledge of the shared resource
+ Community-driven: Publishing is available to all members which enables continuous generation of learning content
+  Voting Based content-evaluation mechanism: each post is subject to be up/down voted by users based on its value which encourages valuable content creation and auto discard (by down-voting a post will lose its relevance and won't show up to users) of low quality posts
+ centralization: enables easy peer-support and offers networking opportunities by enabling users to search for threads, documents ... and find instant replies to their questions
+ peer-networking: being forum-style attracts serious learners which facilitates finding suitable study bodies and cooperation opportunities
